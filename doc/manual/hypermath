Fnord errors: we don't get them at brown because Motif is installed, 
You get them at Wellesley because it isn't. You can ignore them safely. 

Alternately, you can install /home/gerber/mmagid/dtext2/tmp/XKeysymDB
in /usr/lib/X11. (Actually, since you run OpenWindows, it needs to go
in /usr/openwin/lib)
HOWEVER, to do this, you need to have root (system administrator)
access.

On the upside, your backspace/delete keys should work correctly after
that.

To find the file names, go to the Books menu in the table of contents
(TOC) and select "New View" and select the view "fnorse". This will
have no text in it, just section headings and fnorse file names
(without .fnorse on them).
 
Then look at them in /home/gerber/mmagid/dtext2/books/dg/fnord

for fnorse info look at the help book, the fnorse section. 
For the manual, look at fnord/doc/manual/manual.ps - this is a
postscript version you should be able to print on any PostScript
printer. 

Work through the fnorse help in the dynatext book. 

If you want, we can print a copy of the manual out and send it back
with Marty.
