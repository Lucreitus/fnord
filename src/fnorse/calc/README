************
* field
************

Shows the line integral along a circle over a vector field with
a singularity at the origin. You can move the circle around. 

************
* line_int
************

This is supposed to show the value of the line integral along
a sin wave in a vector field, but IT DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY. 

************
* minmax
************

Illustraits the idea of a surface (function graph) taking on a min
and max value over a bounded region (circle). 

************
* project
************

Shows a square (or a circle) projected onto a surface.

************
* strange2
************

A surface that is discontinous at the origin along any 
straight line in x-y, but is continuously 1 if you travel along
the parabola y = x^2.

************
* tanget_plane
************

Tangent plane show at a moveable point for z = x^2 + c*y^2
